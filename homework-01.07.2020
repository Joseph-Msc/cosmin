Create a nested structure as follows:
const listOfFriends = [
  {
    firstName: string,
    lastName: string,
    hobbies: string[], // ['tennis', 'squash', 'football']
    familyMembers: [
      {
        firstName: string,
        lastName: string,
        hobbies: string[], // ['tennis', 'squash', 'football']

      },
      {},
      ...

    ]
  },
  {},
  ...
];
 
In total the list of friends should have at least 20 and each list of family members should have between 2 and maximum 5.
Put this inside a *.js file.
Make sure the list of firends array is correct and valid.
