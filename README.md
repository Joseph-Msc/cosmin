# This is the README of Cosmin

Joseph, your homework for Friday is to create a file inside the cosmin repository where you should explain the difference between an object and an array. To be able to do that, you will have to first state what an object and what an array is. Then, I want you to give two examples for each.  
Once you do that, I need you to tell me (inside the file you will save into the repository) which is which from the bellow

1. []
1. {}
1. [a: a]
1. {a:a}
1. [1, 3, 'Joseph', Avram]
1. [1, 3, 'Joseph', 'Avram']
1. {name: Joseph}
1. {name: "Joseph"}
1. {1, 2, 3, 4}

I've spoke you about objects and arrays for many times so far. They are part of the foundation in programming (any programming language) and the objective of this homework is to have you read by yourself and figure out in depth more about each concept individually.
Please, bear in mind that it is a simple task, straight forward with some tricks (you have to pay attention when you answer).
Not for last, you will have to (with git) pull (I've just added a new file to the cosmin repository and you have to grab that onto your computer), check the status, add to the list of maintained/tracked files, commit and push.

Git is very important in the day to day of a software engineer. It helps share code with other people, track progress, check changes, keep the evidence of incremental changes and much more. You have to get very, very comfortable and familiar with using at least this five or six basic commands.  
Thank you so much. You are doing a very good job so far. And, we are only scratching the surface.  
On Friday, I will explain you a bit more how forms work, how they interact with the server.  
On Monday, we will start a new chapter (this doesn't mean that we are finished with forms, HTML, CSS or the like). We will (for a while) speak about the foundation of programming (loops, iterators, conditionals, operators and the like).
