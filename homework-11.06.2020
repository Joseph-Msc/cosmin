Please create a ES6 file (*.js) and write the following logic.

We have a variable which is true. If the variable is true, console log YES. 
If not, console log NO.

Change va value to null.

Write a switch statement. Case null, console log NULL. Case true, console log TRUE. Default to console log NO.
